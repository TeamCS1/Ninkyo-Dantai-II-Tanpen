# Ninkyo-Dantai-II

# About

The original Ninkyo Dantai II game, developed in GameMaker Studio, with my own custom written engine Blackbox.

The sequel project can be found here - https://github.com/TeamCS1/Ninkyo-Dantai-II-Unity

# Developement Constraints

- GameMaker Studio 3D is limited to 8 hardware lights. I also had a few bugs where some of them were not being switched off/on.
- GameMaker Studio 3D .d3d format is slow.
- Hard to edit, despite my own built 3D Editor
